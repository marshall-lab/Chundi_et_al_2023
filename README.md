This repository provides code and analyses as used in Xu et al, *eLife*, 2023 (in press). The analysis uses CATaDa (i.e. Dam-only binding data) and Bsh TaDa binding data, combined with existing scRNA-seq data, to discover gene expression and motif enrichment associated with Bsh in L4 neurons.

The full analysis can be viewed as a rendered HTML document [here](https://marshall-lab.org/Xu_et_al_2023/), or you can clone the repository and run the Rmd document in Rstudio to generate the analysis and figures.
