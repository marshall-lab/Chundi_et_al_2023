This repository provides code and analyses as used in [Xu, Ramos, Marshall & Doe (2023) Notch signaling and Bsh homeodomain activity are integrated to diversify Drosophila lamina neuron types, *eLife* (in press)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90136.1). 

The analysis uses CATaDa (i.e. Dam-only binding data) and Bsh TaDa binding data, combined with existing scRNA-seq data, to discover gene expression and motif enrichment associated with Bsh in L4 neurons.  The plots generated here were used in Figure 6 and Figure 6 -- figure supplement in the paper.

The full analysis code and output can be viewed as [a pre-rendered HTML document](https://marshall-lab.org/Xu_et_al_2023/), or you can clone the repository and run the Rmd document in Rstudio to generate the analysis and figures.
